    <h1>The Beginning</h1>
    <p>I remember how it felt the very first time I laid eyes on you. As I write this, 
      I struggle to find the words to fully describe that moment. It was as if seeing 
      you brought me a sense of calm and peace I had never known before. I never imagined 
      that something so beautiful could make me feel as though I were at home, wrapped in 
      a warm blanket during a winter storm. My pupils dilated, and all I could think was, “Wow.”
      You were there in the corner, lost in your own little world, and all I wanted was to be a part 
      of it. You looked serious, maybe even a little angry, but I soon learned that’s just how you are 
      sometimes lol. That day, all I could think about was you, a beautiful girl named Grace.

    <h1>Our dates</h1>
    <p>The dates we went on were more than I could have ever asked for. You were shy, 
      and I was nervous, but to me, they were perfect. I’ll never forget our trip to 
      the aquarium, it made my day to see you so happy, touching the stingrays and pointing
       out the fish you loved. Even when we walked what felt like miles trying to find where
        I parked my car (despite me holding the ticket with the address the whole time), 
        it was a day I wouldn’t change one bit. I remember being so worried you wouldn’t text me 
        after that day. But no matter what we did, whether our dates were simple and short or long 
        and chaotic, they were always perfect to me.

    <h1>Together</h1>
    <p>The day I asked you to be mine, you almost said no, telling me you weren’t sure.
       Honestly, it made me nervous smh. But in the end, you decided to give me a chance, 
       and I’ll always be grateful for that. “Imagine” by John Lennon was playing in the 
       background, and from start to finish, we kissed. It might sound corny to say, but to me, 
       it was like straight out of a movie.

    <h1>You</h1>
    <p>I love everything about you, the small and the big. I love the faces you make
      when we're on a call, and somehow you expect me not to screenshot them. When you easily
      predict how a movie will continue it's story and you voice your opinion on it
      in a quiet theater full of people. How you randomly stare at me while I drive, 
      somehow I feel my heart beating faster everytime you do that. You always know when to
      boost my self-esteem.

    <h1>The future</h1>
    <p>Sometimes I worry about the future. I look at you, and I never want any 
      kind of distance between us, but I know it's not realistic to think of the 
      possibility of us being further away than we are now. But as much as that 
      possibility may be, I know the sacrifice will pay off. What the future has 
      for us is much greater than the obstacles we'll face, and I know you'll 
      always be there with me.
